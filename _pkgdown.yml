reference:
- title: Page Layouts
  desc: >
    Page layouts are the basic building blocks of any UI. bslib pages always
    include Bootstrap and can be themed with bslib's [theming capabilities](#theming).
- subtitle: Dashboard layouts
  desc: >
    These page layouts work best for dashboards. For a single-page dashboards
    with an optional sidebar, try `page_sidebar()`. For multi-tab dashboards
    organized as pages in a navbar, also with an optional sidebar, try
    `page_navbar()`. For a full-page dashboard with items that fill the screen,
    try `page_fillable()`.
- contents:
    - page_sidebar
    - page_navbar
    - page_fillable
- subtitle: Basic page layouts
  desc: >
    bslib variants of classic Shiny page layouts.
- contents:
    - page

- title: User Interface Layouts
  desc: >
    These functions help you layout the user interface (UI) elements of your
    app.
- subtitle: Multiple columns
  desc: |
    Organize inputs and outputs into Bootstrap's
    [12-column CSS grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/css-grid/)
    with `layout_columns()` or into a responsive, column-first grid layout with
    `layout_column_wrap()`. Place a sidebar next to any UI elements with
    `layout_sidebar()`.
  contents:
    - layout_columns
    - layout_column_wrap
    - layout_sidebar
- subtitle: Multiple panels
  desc: |
    Create tabbed sections of content. First, choose the style of navigation
    container. Then add navigation panels or items to the container. You can
    programmatically control or update the navigation containers with
    server-side logic.
  contents:
    - navset
    - nav-items
    - nav_select

- title: Components
  desc: >
    bslib brings a collection of Bootstrap components to Shiny. These components
    require the latest version of Bootstrap and work best when used with the
    [page functions listed above](#page-layouts).
- subtitle: Accordions
  desc: |
    Create collapsible sections of content. Each collapsible section is defined
    with `accordion_panel()` and the collection of sections are grouped together
    within an `accordion()`.
  contents:
    - accordion
    - accordion_panel_set
- subtitle: Cards
  desc: |
    Cards are a great way to group content into a single, contained unit. Cards
    combine nicely with many other functions in bslib. They can be added to
    [dashboard page layouts](#dashboard-layouts), laid out with helpers like
    `layout_columns()`, or have sidebars when used with `layout_sidebar()`. You
    can even create [tabbed card interfaces](#navigation) with the `navset_card_*()` functions.
  contents:
    - card
    - as.card_item
- subtitle: Input controls
  desc: |
    UI controls for capturing user input
  contents:
    - input_switch
    - input_dark_mode
- subtitle: Tooltips & Popovers
  desc: |
    Provide details on demand. In general, tooltips are ephemeral and provide a
    little extra information when the user hovers over or focuses on an element.
    Popovers are more persistent and are triggered by a click or via the
    keyboard. Popovers can include more content than tooltips -- even Shiny
    inputs and outputs!
  contents:
    - tooltip
    - popover
- subtitle: Value box
  desc: |
    Value boxes are a special type of card that highlight a single piece of
    information, optionally showcasing an icon or plot. They are often used in
    [dashboard layouts](#dashboard-layouts) to highlight key metrics.
  contents:
    - value_box

- title: Theming
  desc: >
    bslib provides a flexible interface for customizing Bootstrap themes. You
    can create your own Bootstrap themes, customize existing themes, or create
    dynamic themes that can even be modified at runtime.

  desc: |

    customized theme, or use a preset theme -- either built into bslib or
