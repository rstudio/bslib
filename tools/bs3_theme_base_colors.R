# This script generates code for replacing hardcoded colors for Bootstrap 3.
# Unlike Bootstrap 4, the Bootstrap 3 _variables.scss has a lot of repeated
# color literals. We want to replace all of the ones that are monochrome with
# dynamically calculated replacements.

# Load bootstrap-sass (bs3) _variables.scss
lines <- readLines(
  system.file(
    package = "bslib",
    "lib/bs3/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss"
  )
)
# Retain lines that seem like they contain a hex color.
# (Note that colors specified by keyword would break this logic, but, AFAICT,
# there aren't any such colors in _variables.scss.)
lines <- lines[grepl("#[0-9a-f-A-F]", lines, perl = TRUE)]

# Parse each line into variable name and hex color
df <- data.frame(
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
  name = sub("^\\$(.+?):.*", "\\1", lines, perl = TRUE),
  color = sub(".*(#[0-9A-Za-z]+).*", "\\1", lines, perl = TRUE)
)
# Sort by color value
df <- df[order(df$color), ]

# All of the color values that we want to replace, are assigned a variable name.
# Any variables in _variables.scss that point to one of these color values, will
# now point to the variable name by default. For example, since _variables.scss
# contains this:
#
#   $navbar-inverse-bg: #222 !default;
#
# Our goal is to generate the rule:
#
#   $navbar-inverse-bg: $gray-darker !default;
#
# So that all such variables (i.e. ones whose default value is #222) can be
# changed just by modifying $gray-darker.
named_colors <- c(
  # These variables already exist in _variables.scss
  "gray-base" = "#000",
  "gray-darker" = "#222",
  "gray-dark" = "#333",
  "gray" = "#555",
  "gray-light" = "#777",
  "gray-lighter" = "#eee",

  # These are variables we're introducing
  "gray-44" = "#444",
  "gray-88" = "#888",
  "gray-99" = "#999",
  "gray-cc" = "#ccc",

# Color variables in _variables.scss that we don't have names for.
# Consider this a potential TODO list of colors we could dynamically set.
