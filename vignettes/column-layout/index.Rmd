This article outlines various layouts made possible by `layout_column_wrap()`. To illustrate, we'll use three `card()` instances with varying content, but keep in mind that `layout_column_wrap()` is designed to work other UI elements as well, such as [value boxes](../value-boxes) or even for [multiple columns within a card](../cards/#multiple-columns).

**Note:** The examples in this section are not intended to be viewed on mobile devices. At small window widths, all of the layouts here collapse into a more mobile-friendly approach of "show each card at maximum width".

```{r}
library(bslib)

card1 <- card(
  card_header("Scrolling content"),
  lapply(
    lorem::ipsum(paragraphs = 3, sentences = c(5, 5, 5)),
    tags$p
  )
)
card2 <- card(
  card_header("Nothing much here"),
  "This is it."
)
card3 <- card(
  full_screen = TRUE,
  card_header("Filling content"),
  card_body(
    class = "p-0",
    shiny::plotOutput("p")
  )
)
```


### Uniform width and height

When displaying multiple cards (or value boxes, etc) at once, it's often most visually appealing to have them displayed in a grid-like layout where each card has the same height and width. `layout_column_wrap()` optimizes for this design principle, and only demands a `width` for each column (or a number of columns). In the event that there are more cards than columns available, cards are wrapped into a new row (by default, all rows have the same height, but you can easily [vary the row height](#by-row)).

#### Fixed number of columns

For a fixed number of columns, provide `width = 1/n`, where `n` is the number of columns.[^2] As the animation (except on mobile devices) below shows, as the width of the `layout_column_wrap()` container changes, each card grows or shrinks to maintain its 1/2 width.

[^2]: Do not attempt to use percent-based widths with `width`--like `"50%"` instead of `1/2`. Percentages will almost certainly not give you the results you want.

```{r}
layout_column_wrap(
  width = 1/2, height = 300,
  card1, card2, card3
) |>
  anim_width("100%", "67%")
```

One potential issue with a fixed number of columns is that, on medium sized screens, the card width may become too small. If that happens to be a problem, specifying a "responsive" number of columns may be preferable.

#### Responsive number of columns

For a responsive number of columns (i.e., the number of columns depends on the window size), provide `width` with any valid CSS unit, like 200 pixels. In our case (with three cards), the 3rd card gets wrapped onto a new line when the viewport is less than 600 pixels, but on wider screens, the cards equally distribute the free space.

```{r}
layout_column_wrap(
  width = "200px", height = 300,
  card1, card2, card3
) |>
  anim_width("100%", "67%")
```


#### Fixed column width

To keep the `width` of each column fixed (don't allow cards to grow to take up free space), set `fixed_width = TRUE`.

```{r}
layout_column_wrap(
  width = "200px", height = 300,
  fixed_width = TRUE,
  card1, card2, card3
) |>
  anim_width("100%", "67%")
```


### Varying heights

By default, when `layout_column_wrap()` wraps columns onto a new row, _all_ rows are given equal height.

#### By row

To allow the height of each row to be different, set `heights_equal = "row"`:

```{r}
layout_column_wrap(
  width = 1/2,
  heights_equal = "row",
  card1, card3, card2
) |>
  anim_height(300, 450)
```

#### By cell

By default, each the height on each card grows to fill the available vertical space in a particular row. This can be prevented

```{r}
layout_column_wrap(
  width = "200px",
  #heights_equal = "row",
  fillable = FALSE,
  card1, card3, card2
) |>
  anim_height(300, 450)
```


### Varying widths

Set `width` to `NULL` and provide a custom [`grid-template-columns` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-columns) (and possibly other [CSS grid properties](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)) to accomplish more complex layouts, like varying column widths. This particular layout gives the 1st and 3rd card twice as much space as the 2nd:

```{r}
layout_column_wrap(
  width = NULL, height = 300, fill = FALSE,
  style = css(grid_template_columns = "2fr 1fr 2fr"),
  card1, card2, card3
) |>
  anim_height(300, 450)
```

### Nested layouts

More complex layouts can be achieved by leveraging the fact that `layout_column_wrap()` can appear within another `layout_column_wrap()`s. For example

```{r}
layout_column_wrap(
  width = 1/2,
  height = 300,
  card1,
  layout_column_wrap(
    width = 1,
    heights_equal = "row",
    card2, card3
  )
)
```

### Other grid-based layouts

`layout_column_wrap()` provides a simplified interface to [CSS grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) that won't accommodate everything it can do. In this case, we recommend using `{gridlayout}` and/or the [Shiny UI editor](https://rstudio.github.io/shinyuieditor/) to produce the layout.

## Appendix

In the spirit of reproducibility, this section discloses custom CSS and R code used in the examples above.

The following CSS is used to give `plotOutput()` a background color; it's necessary here because this documentation page is not actually hooked up to a Shiny app, so we can't show a real plot.

```{css}
.shiny-plot-output {
  background-color: #216B7288;
  height: 400px;
  width: 100%;
}
```

These R functions add animation-related CSS class and styles to whatever tags you give it.

```{r anim_helpers, echo=TRUE, results="hide"}
library(htmltools)

anim_width <- function(x, width1, width2) {
  x |> tagAppendAttributes(
    class = "animate-width",
    style = css(
      `--width1` = validateCssUnit(width1),
      `--width2` = validateCssUnit(width2),
    ),
  )
}

anim_height <- function(x, height1, height2) {
  # Wrap in a div fixed at the height of height2, so the rest of
  # the content on the page doesn't shift up and down
  div(style = css(height = validateCssUnit(height2)),
    x |> tagAppendAttributes(
      class = "animate-height",
      style = css(
        `--height1` = validateCssUnit(height1),
        `--height2` = validateCssUnit(height2),
      ),
    )
  )
}
```

And here are the CSS animation rules that power those `anim_width` and `anim_height` R functions.

```{css}
@keyframes changewidth {
  from { width: var(--width1); }
  25% { width: var(--width1); }
  50% { width: var(--width2); }
  75% { width: var(--width2); }
  to { width: var(--width1); }
}
.animate-width {
  animation-duration: 6s;
  animation-name: changewidth;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  border-right: 2px solid #DDD;
  padding-right: 1rem;
  padding-bottom: 3rem;
}

@keyframes changeheight {
  from { height: var(--height1); }
  25% { height: var(--height1); }
  50% { height: var(--height2); }
  75% { height: var(--height2); }
  to { height: var(--height1); }
}
.animate-height {
  height: 600px;
  animation-duration: var(--anim-duration, 6s);
  animation-name: changeheight;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  padding-bottom: 3rem;
}
```
