[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) is an CSS extension language that helps reduce complexity and increase composability when styling a website. [Bootstrap Sass]() is just one example of a Sass-based project that exposes Sass variables to allow users to easily customize CSS styles. 


TODO: do a better job here

When a `bs_theme()` is used with Shiny or R Markdown, the `{sass}` object underlying the theme object is [compiled into CSS](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/articles/sass.html#why) at run-time. Compared to custom theming by overlaying additional CSS rules (which, historically, has been the only way to implement custom themes), there are at least a few huge benefits in taking the Sass based approach:

* [Sass variables](variables.html) (e.g., `$border-radius`) provide a useful abstraction to not only reduce the amount of code you need to write, but it also protects you from future changes in HTML/CSS markup that may end up breaking your CSS rules.

* The [Sass language](https://sass-lang.com) itself provides many useful tools for writing CSS more elegantly (i.e., [variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables), functions, and mixins) as well as many useful utiltiles for computing with CSS values (e.g., color

* Sass variables not only generate a custom build of Bootstrap CSS (thus, avoiding duplicated CSS rules), but it also gives 3rd party components the opportunity to provide better default styles based on underlying `{sass}` object (thanks to `{bslib}`'s [theming tools for custom components](#custom-components)). 
    * This shift in approach allows sophisticated, custom, components like `shiny::sliderInput()`, `shiny::dateRangeInput()`, `DT::datatable()`, etc. "just work" with custom and [dynamically updating themes](#dynamic-shiny).
