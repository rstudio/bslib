# bslib

The `bslib` R package provides tools for customizing [Bootstrap themes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/theming/) directly from R, making it much easier to customize the appearance of [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps & [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents. `bslib`'s primary goals are: 

* Make [custom theming](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/bslib.html#custom) as easy as possible.
  * Custom themes may even be created interactively in [real-time](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/bslib.html#real-time).
* Also provide easy access to pre-packaged [Bootswatch themes](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/bslib.html#bootswatch).
* Make [upgrading from Bootstrap 3 to 4 (and beyond)](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/bslib.html#versions) as seamless as possible.
  * Shiny and R Markdown default to Bootstrap 3 and will continue to do so to avoid breaking legacy code.
* Serve as a general foundation for Shiny and R Markdown extension packages such as `{flexdashboard}`, `{pkgdown}`, `{bookdown}`, etc.

## Installation

Install the stable release of `bslib` on CRAN:

```r
install.packages("bslib")
```

Usage with Shiny requires version 1.6 or higher:

```r
install.packages("shiny")
```

Usage with R Markdown requires version 2.7 or higher:

```r
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

## Basic usage {#usage}

`bslib` is designed for use with any Shiny or R Markdown project that uses Bootstrap. In most cases, you can identify a project that uses Bootstrap when the relevant page constructor has a `theme` parameter. For example, most Shiny page layout functions (e.g., `shiny::navbarPage()`) and some popular R Markdown formats (e.g., `rmarkdown::html_document`) all have a `theme` parameter. 

To use `bslib` in Shiny, provide a `bs_theme()` _object_ to the `theme` parameter; and in R Markdown, provide `bs_theme()` _parameters_ to `theme`. For example, here's a way to upgrade Shiny (left) and R Markdown (right) from Bootstrap 3 to 4:

<div class="usage">
```r
library(shiny)
ui <- navbarPage(
  theme = bs_theme(version = 4),
  ...
)
shinyApp(ui, function(...) {})
```
```r
---
output:
  html_document:
    theme:
      version: 4
---
```
</div>

See the [Get Started](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/bslib.html) article to learn more about Bootstrap versions, pre-packaged Bootswatch themes, (real-time) custom theming, and more.

To get started more quickly, choose a relevant R Markdown template from inside RStudio by going to File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/rstudio-templates.png")
```

## Getting help

There are two main places to get help with `bslib`:

+ The [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/tags/c/R-Markdown/10/bslib) is a friendly place to ask any questions about flexdashboard. Be sure to use the `bslib` tag. Add also the `shiny` tag is you are using a Shiny runtime.

+ [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bslib) is a great source of answers to common `bslib` questions. It is also a great place to get help, once you have created a reproducible example that illustrates your problem. Use the tags [`[r][bslib]`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bslib+r) if you ask a question. Add the tag `[bslib]` if you are using a Shiny runtime.
