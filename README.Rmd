# bslib (formerly known as bootstraplib)

The `{bslib}` R package provides tools for creating custom [Bootstrap themes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/theming/), making it easier to style Shiny apps and R Markdown documents directly from R without writing unruly CSS and HTML. Currently, `{bslib}` provides Bootstrap 4, Bootstrap 3, as well as a custom `"4+3"` compatibility version, which helps upgrade Shiny and R Markdown from Bootstrap 3 to 4.

## Installation

`{bslib}` isn't yet available from CRAN, but you can install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("rstudio/bslib")
```

## Getting Started

### Create a theme

Use `bs_theme()` to create a `{bslib}` theme, where you can:

-   Choose a (major) Bootstrap version.

    -   To current `version_default()` is `r version_default()`, which means Bootstrap `r substr(version_default(), 1, 1)` plus an additional compatibility layer for Bootstrap 3 navs, navbars, and more. This compatibility allows most Shiny apps and R Markdown documents to seamlessly upgrade to Bootstrap `r substr(version_default(), 1, 1)`.

-   Choose a [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) theme (optional).

-   Customize the main colors and fonts (see below).

-   More generally, customize any of Bootstrap's styling defaults via Sass variables.

For example, to implement a [material design inspired dark mode](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html):

``` r
library(bslib)
my_theme <- bs_theme(
  bg = "#202123", fg = "#B8BCC2", primary = "#EA80FC", 
  base_font = "Grandstander"
)
```

### Shiny usage

> Note: this usage requires the development version of Shiny `remotes::install_github("rstudio/shiny")`.

To use `my_theme` inside of Shiny, pass it to the relevant `theme` parameter in page functions such as `shiny::navbarPage()`, `shiny::fluidPage()`, `shiny::bootstrapPage()`, etc.

``` r
library(shiny)
ui <- navbarPage(
  theme = my_theme,
  ...
)
shinyApp(ui, function(input, output) {})
```

For a preview of how `my_theme` impacts most of Shiny UI's styling defaults, provide it to `bs_theme_preview()`. This preview app includes most "core" Shiny UI functionality as well as an interactive "real-time" theming widget for quickly testing out new colors and fonts. To help replicate those styling changes, the widgets also emits code to the R console. It can also be used with other Shiny apps via `run_with_themer()` (or `bs_themer()`).

``` r
bs_theme_preview(my_theme)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/KLKy1s0.gif")
```

More generally, you can use a Bootstrap theme with any HTML page by using `shiny::bootstrapLib()` to provide the theme as an `htmltools::htmlDependency()` to an `shiny::htmlTemplate()` or any HTML `htmltools::tags` that you wish, for example:

``` r
library(shiny)
ui <- htmlTemplate(
  "my-template.html",
  theme = my_theme,
  ...
)
shinyApp(ui, function(input, output) {})
```

``` html
<!-- my-template.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    {{ headContent() }}
    {{ bootstrapLib(theme) }}
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```

### R Markdown usage

> Note: this usage currently requires an experimental version of R Markdown `remotes::install_github("rstudio/rmarkdown#1706")`

To use a `bs_theme()` in R Markdown, pass the relevant theming parameter(s) to the `theme` parameter of `html_document` (or, really, anything that runs through `html_document_base`):

``` yaml
---
output:
  html_document:
    theme:
      bg: "#202123"
      fg: "#B8BCC2"
      primary: "#EA80FC"
      base_font: "Grandstander"
---
```

For backwards-compatibility reasons, R Markdown only uses `{bslib}` when `theme` is a list of parameters, so if you want to just use Bootstrap 4 without any custom theming, you must do:

``` yaml
---
output:
  html_document:
    theme:
      version: 4+3
---
```

Moreover, when `theme` depicts a `bs_theme()`, you may modify the (global) `theme` in **knitr** code chunks to influence the final Bootstrap CSS bundle included in the output document. This means you can do things like dynamically modify theme default(s) (with `bs_global_theme_update()` ) and/or add additional CSS rules that leverage Bootstrap Sass variables, functions, mixins, etc:

    ```{r}`r ''`
    library(bslib)
    bs_global_theme_update("input-bg" = "purple")
    bs_global_add_rules(
      ".my-class { 
         background-color: mix($body-bg, $body-color, 90%);
         border: 1px solid $primary;
         @include border_radius($border-radius);
       }
      "
    )
    ```
